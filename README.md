# **HybridSN**

This is a personal *pytorch-based* implement of **HybridSN** by Jupyter notebook.

The HybridSN is spectral-spatial 3D-CNN followed by spatial 2D-CNN.The 3D-CNN facilitates the joint spatial-spectral feature representation from a stack of spectral bands. The 2D-CNN on top of the 3D-CNN further learns more abstract level spatial representation.
